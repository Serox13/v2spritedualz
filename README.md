Config files for klipper installs
This is working bin config files for Ender 3 V2 Sprite extruder and dual z axis
i have done a lot of testing to get these numbers [build plate size is of a pei sheet with no clips]
These are all working files from 2023
i went through hours of pain getting klipper installed and calibrated to where it is now
i hope i can help some ppl save a few hrs in the process of installing klipper
