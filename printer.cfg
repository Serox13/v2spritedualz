# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3
# Pro with the 32-bit Creality 4.2.2 board. To use this config, during
# "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and
# serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.

# It should be noted that newer variations of this printer shipping in
# 2022 may have GD32F103 chips installed and not STM32F103. You may
# have to inspect the mainboard to ascertain which one you have. If it
# is the GD32F103 then please select Disable SWD at startup in the
# "make menuconfig" along with the same settings for STM32F103.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select
# serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10), which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC
# cable used for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
## All customizations are documented in globals.cfg. Just copy a variable from
# there into the section below, and change the value to meet your needs.

# These are examples of some likely customizations:
# Any sheets in the below list will be available with a configurable offset.
#variable_bed_surfaces: ['smooth_1','texture_1']
# Length (in mm) of filament to load (bowden tubes will be longer).
#variable_load_length: 90.0
# Hide the Octoprint LCD menu since I don't use it.
#variable_menu_show_octoprint: False
# Customize the filament menus (up to 10 entries).

# Length of filament (in millimeters) to purge at print start.
#variable_start_purge_length: 30 # This value works for most setups.
#gcode: # This line is required by Klipper.
# Any code you put here will run at klipper startup, after the initialization
# for these macros. For example, you could uncomment the following line to
# automatically adjust your bed surface offsets to account for any changes made
# to your Z endstop or probe offset.
#  ADJUST_SURFACE_OFFSETS

# This line includes all the standard macros.

# Uncomment to include features that require specific hardware support.
# LCD menu support for features like bed surface selection and pause next layer.
#[include klipper-macros/optional/lcd_menus.cfg]
# Optimized bed leveling
#[include klipper-macros/optional/bed_mesh.cfg]

# The sections below here are required for the macros to work. If your config
# already has some of these sections you should merge the duplicates into one
# (or if they are identical just remove one of them).
